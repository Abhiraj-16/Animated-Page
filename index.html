                <h1>My Story</h1>
                <p>A blockchain game is a video game that includes elements that use cryptography-based blockchain technologies. Blockchain elements in these games are most often based on 
                    the use of cryptocurrency or non-fungible tokens which players can buy, sell, or trade with other players. </p>

                <h1>Another Story</h1>
                <p>A blockchain platform allows users and developers to create novel uses of an existing blockchain infrastructure. One example is Ethereum, which has a native cryptocurrency known as ether (ETH). But the Ethereum blockchain also allows the creation of smart contracts and programmable tokens used in initial coin offerings (ICOs), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 
                    These are all built up around the Ethereum infrastructure and secured by nodes on the Ethereum network.</p>
